# House Price Prediction

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict house prices based on various features. The model is built using the **XGBoost Regressor**, a powerful and efficient algorithm for regression tasks.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict the price of houses based on several factors such as the number of rooms, property size, crime rates, etc. The dataset used in this project is the **Boston House Price Dataset**, which includes features like crime rate, average number of rooms, property age, and more.

## Dependencies

The following Python libraries are used in this project:

- **Numpy**: For numerical operations
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning and data preprocessing
- **XGBoost**: For building the regression model

To install the required libraries, run:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost
